The user enters the title of a movie they have seen. The movie title gets searched using the omdb api which returns the five most likely movies the user may have meant. The user selects from these five movies and adds their rating out of five stars for the movie.

The user can search through the collection of movies they have seen to change their rating or just to see if they have seen that movie before. They also have the option to add the date they watched the movie.
